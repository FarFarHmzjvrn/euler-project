Solving a series of Euler project questions

I don't have any comments on the problem. I am satisfied with the execution time. It has a good performance. I think one can still optimize the code to make it is still faster and better.

Please do comment if you  have a different program/better program or have any suggestion. I will be glad to view each of them.:smiley::blue_heart:
